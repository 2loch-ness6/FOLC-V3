## 📋 Project Overview

FOLC-V3 transforms the **Orbic Speed 5G Hotspot (Model RC400L)** into a portable embedded Linux security appliance, similar in concept to devices like the Flipper Zero or WiFi Pineapple, but utilizing commodity cellular hardware.

The device becomes capable of:
- **Network Security Auditing:** WiFi scanning, packet capture, network mapping
- **Wireless Testing:** Monitor mode, packet injection, deauth attacks
- **Penetration Testing:** Portable toolkit with nmap, aircrack-ng, tcpdump, scapy
- **Custom Interface:** Physical button-driven UI on the device's built-in screen
- **Remote Access:** Backdoor shell access via ADB for advanced operations

### What Makes This Interesting?

1. **Cheap & Available:** The RC400L is an inexpensive, mass-produced device
2. **Capable Hardware:** Qualcomm MDM9207, WiFi with monitor mode, 5G modem
3. **Portable:** Battery-powered, pocket-sized, inconspicuous form factor
4. **Rooted:** Full root access with unrestricted capabilities
5. **Dual-Boot Approach:** Maintains vendor firmware while adding custom Alpine Linux environment

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Exploit Chain

1. **Initial Access:** Discovery of SUID binary `/bin/rootshell` (restricted root)
2. **Privilege Escalation:** Identified `rayhunter-daemon` runs with full capabilities
3. **Persistence:** Replace daemon with wrapper script that inherits privileges
4. **Environment:** Mount Alpine Linux chroot at `/data/alpine`
5. **Backdoor:** Spawn netcat listener on localhost:9999

### System Layout

```
Orbic Speed (RC400L)
├── Host OS (Qualcomm Embedded Linux)
│   ├── /bin/rootshell (SUID exploit vector)
│   ├── /data/rayhunter/ (persistence location)
│   └── /dev/fb0, /dev/input/* (hardware access)
│
└── Alpine Linux Chroot (/data/alpine)
    ├── Security Tools (aircrack-ng, nmap, tcpdump)
    ├── Python Environment (UI & automation)
    └── Package Manager (apk)
```

### Access Methods

1. **Physical UI:** 128x128 screen + 2 buttons (standalone operation)
2. **Frontdoor (Primary):** `adb shell su` - Persistent SUID root binary
3. **Backdoor (Fallback):** `adb forward tcp:9999 tcp:9999; nc 127.0.0.1 9999`
4. **ADB Root:** Optional `nosetuid.so` for automatic root in all ADB shells

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Orbic Speed (RC400L) device
- USB cable
- Computer with ADB installed
- Linux/macOS recommended (Windows works with WSL)

### Installation

> **⚠️ Warning:** This will modify your device. Backup any important data first.

1. **Enable ADB on device:**
   ```bash
   # Device should be detected when plugged in
   adb devices
   ```

2. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/2loch-ness6/FOLC-V3.git
   cd FOLC-V3
   ```

3. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   ./tools/setup.sh
   ```
   
   This will:
   - Verify device connectivity
   - Install the exploit chain
   - Set up Alpine Linux chroot
   - Install security tools
   - Deploy the custom UI

4. **Access the backdoor:**
   ```bash
   adb forward tcp:9999 tcp:9999
   nc 127.0.0.1 9999
   ```

For detailed instructions, see [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)

### Testing

Run the comprehensive test suite to verify your installation:

```bash
# Run all tests
./tools/test_folc.sh
```

This test suite:
- ✅ Verifies device connectivity and root access
- ✅ Tests Alpine Linux chroot functionality
- ✅ Validates FOLC UI installation
- ✅ Checks network capabilities
- ✅ Tests both backdoor and frontdoor access methods
- ✅ Generates detailed logs and reports

The test script is designed to run on Android 14 devices within either:
- **Termux** environment
- **Kali Linux Chroot** on Android

It uses the system ADB binary (`/bin/adb`) provided by Magisk for optimal stability.

## 💡 Usage

### Physical Interface

The device UI is controlled with two buttons:

- **Menu Button (Short Press):** Navigate down / Next item
- **Power Button (Short Press):** Select / Confirm action  
- **Power Button (Long Press):** Context menu / System info
- **Menu Button (Long Press):** Back / Cancel

### Available Functions

1. **SCAN FREQUENCIES:** Discover nearby WiFi networks
2. **PACKET HARVEST:** Capture network traffic to .pcap files
3. **DEAUTH PULSE:** Send deauthentication frames (WiFi testing)
4. **SYSTEM INFO:** View device status and diagnostics
5. **REBOOT:** Restart the device

### Command Line Access

**Method 1: Frontdoor (Recommended)**
```bash
# Direct root access via su
adb shell su -c "command"

# Enter the Alpine chroot
adb shell "su -c 'chroot /data/alpine /bin/bash'"

# Interactive root shell
adb shell su
```

**Method 2: Backdoor (Fallback)**
```bash
# Forward the backdoor port
adb forward tcp:9999 tcp:9999

# Connect to root shell
nc 127.0.0.1 9999

# Enter the Alpine chroot
chroot /data/alpine /bin/bash

# Now you have full access to all tools:
tcpdump -i wlan0 -w capture.pcap
nmap -sn 192.168.1.0/24
airmon-ng start wlan0
```
